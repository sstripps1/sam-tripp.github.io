## Basics
- I'm Canadian and grew up in a town called Aurora, about 45km north of Toronto. Aurora is a quiet and wholesome town and was a nice place to grow up, although perhaps is not the most exciting place to live as an adult.
- My birthday is on September 3rd, making me a Virgo (by the way, I don't really subscribe to astrology and do not believe there is any meaningful correlation between date of birth and personality traits, however I think it's a fun point of conversation - for example, did you know that Beyonc√© is also a Virgo?)

## Interests
Some of my main interests are as follows:

### Music
I consume a lot of music (probably my favourite type of media) and am always on the hunt for new songs to add to my library. I can enjoy a song from pretty much any genre, but my top genres tend to be altnerative/indie, female rap, and rock. I like songs of different genres in different ways and for different reasons, but abstractly, I like any song where the artist takes me on a journey and sells that journey to me with sincerity. Some of my favourite artists are: Hippo Campus, Arcade Fire, The Paper Kites, Nicki Minaj, Phoebe Bridgers, Sexyy Red, Megan Thee Stallion, The National, Summer Salt, The 1975, Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, Jesse Ware, Adrianne Lenker, Lorde, and so many more.

I'm currently trying to learn how to play the guitar so I can take my experience of music to the next level.

### Running
Growing up, I could not understand how anyone could enjoy running, as I found it exhausting and tedious. But in the last few years my mindset has shifted, and now running is one of my favourite things to do. I find it so freeing and therapeutic, and of course I enjoy the fitness benefits that come alongside it.

I much prefer outdoor running over treadmill running, and when choosing an route to run, I try to find somewhere that is 1) flat 2) uninterrupted and 3) beautiful (it can be a tall order finding all 3, so I typically stick to the same spot once I find one that satisfies the criteria).

### Yoga
I started doing yoga on YouTube during the pandemic as a way to alleviate stress and increase strength and flexibility, and pretty quickly I noticed positive changes in all of the above. Since then I've completed my 200 hour Yoga Teacher training course and have taught a few informal classes here and there, and have continued to develop my own practise to be better suited to my areas that need work.

### Travelling
I've done a decent amount of travelling in my life so far (19 countries to date), and I love exploring new landscapes, foods, and cultures. I recently took some time off for a year and a half long backpacking trip, [which you can read about here](https://samtripp.ca/blog/2024/08/30/sams-travel-blog).
