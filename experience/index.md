## Work Experience
### Dash Solutions Architect
*Plotly - Montréal, Canada*\
2020 (Intern), 2021 - 2022 (Full time)

In this role I was a member of the Professional Services team, which essentially acted as Plotly’s consulting unit for current and prospective clients using the Dash Enterprise software. Dash Enterprise is a framework for developing, designing, and deploying data applications written in Python.

For some clients, this meant simply meant providing guidance on how Dash Enterprise could be best suited to their use case. For others, this meant building full scale, production grade applications, including full stack development, performance optimization and testing, usability testing, security auditing, and more. Such projects also included many project management responsibilities, including discussions with clients about project requirements, ensuring deliverables were achieved within the designated time frames, coordinating internal resources to resolve any issues with the product, and developing strong rapport with clients.

Our clients came from a variety of sectors, including finance, life science, business analytics, infrastructure, raw materials, and more.

Here’s a bit more detail on some of my project management tasks and tools:
- Assisting with drafting statements of work (project scope/deliverables, number of consulting hours, etc.)
- Using project management software such as JIRA (following agile development) and Zendesk
- Managing internal resources pertaining to the project (delegating tasks to colleagues, coordinating support from the engineering team, etc.)

The following are some of the technical tools that I used:
- Python: pandas, numpy, oop, vaex
- Databases: SQL, Redis, Postgres
- Frameworks/Platforms: Flask, AWS, Azure
- Frontend: CSS, HTML, Canva
- Version control: Git, CI/CD pipelines, unit testing
- Other: Bash, Celery (task scheduler), JMeter (load testing)

I was also responsible for preparing and presenting instructional workshops about the usage of the product. These workshops were attended by users of many different backgrounds and levels of technical expertise, so it was important to cater them in such a way that the most people reaped the most benefit from them. This was a great exercise in disseminating technical information in a palatable and engaging way.

Overall, my time at Plotly provided me with a wide range of experiences, both technical and non-technical. I liked the fact that I worked at the intersection between coding and working with clients - and it certainly increased my interest in the latter.

### Portfolio and Product Co-op
*Purpose Investments - Toronto, Canada*\
2019

Purpose Investments is an asset management company that manages a number of products, mainly ETFs and mutual funds. As an intern on the product team, I was responsible for many technical and non-technical tasks in supporting the success of the various funds.

One of the main responsibilities of the product team was to create internal reporting tools to provide various financial analytics relating to the performance of the funds and the overall market. I wrote Python code for development of some of these tools, which included retrieving, transforming, and analyzing data, and then creating API endpoints to for the analytics to be fed into the reporting tools. I also wrote corresponding technical documentation for these analytics.

I also wrote automation for the creation of a daily end-of-day report on the performance of the funds, increasing the efficiency of the report creation by ~90%.

On the non-technical side, some of my other responsibilities included things such as creating and styling slide decks, writing market summaries, drafting and proof-reading reports, and assisting other teams with ad hoc tasks. I even got to act in a promotional commercial for the company.

This internship was great for not only honing my technical skills, but becoming more well rounded in other business skills as well.

### Junior Python Engineer
*CPP Investments - Toronto, Canada*\
2019

At CPP Investments, I was an intern on the Portfolio Engineering team, which is a subset of the Quantitative Strategies and Risk Premia group - essentially, a group that makes investments based on an algorithmic or quantitive (“quant”) strategy.

One of my main projects was to continue development on an internal tool designed to compare data between production and test environments, including querying data from a SQL database, transforming data, representing results in a tabular or graphical format, and presenting results.

As my first internship in software, my time at CPP Investments was a great chance for me to learn industry best practices and understand how programming works in a professional context, while simultaneously learning a lot about the world of finance and particularly quantitative finance.


### Lab Research Technician
*Centre for Microbial Chemical Biology (McMaster University) - Hamilton, Canada*\
2018

The Centre for Microbial Chemical Biology (CMCB) is a lab within the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University in Hamilton Canada. The lab is home to several PI’s with varying research topics, but many are focused on drug discovery, particularly antibiotic drug discovery, in order to combat the rising issue of antibiotic resistant infections.

I worked as a lab assistant in the core facility of this centre. Some of my main tasks included assisting researchers with carrying out their high throughput screening assays, performing QA testing on various pieces of lab equipment, and providing training to grad students on lab safety and proper equipment use.

This role allowed me to improve my ability to work quickly and accurately in a fast paced, constantly changing environment. I’m very thankful for the professional development that this experience afforded me.


### Teaching Assistant
*University of Waterloo - Waterloo, Canada*\
2017 - 2018

During my undergrad at Waterloo, I spent 3 terms working as a teaching assistant in Biology labs. In this position, I was responsible for running the labs from start to finish with my students. This included presenting pre-lab presentations about the theory behind the day’s experiment, supervising and assisting students as they carried out the experiment, and completing all marking and evaluations for my students.

Additionally, during my last term as a TA, I co-lead a project to pilot new teaching resources for the first year lab course. This involved assessing the effectiveness of the current resources, strategizing how they could be improved, and creating new and improved resources to be rolled out the following term.

My time as a TA taught me how to better understand how students think, and adjust how I present information accordingly to maximize understanding.
