### Work Experience
#### Dash Solutions Architect
*Plotly - Montréal, Canada*\
2020 (Intern), 2021 - 2022 (Full time)

In this role I was a member of the Professional Services team, which essentially acted as Plotly’s consulting unit for current and prospective clients using the Dash Enterprise software. Dash Enterprise is a framework for developing, designing, and deploying data applications written in Python.

For some clients, this meant simply meant providing guidance on how Dash Enterprise could be best suited to their use case. For others, this meant building full scale, production grade applications, including full stack development, performance optimization and testing, usability testing, security auditing, and more. Such projects also included many project management responsibilities, including discussions with clients about project requirements, ensuring deliverables were achieved within the designated time frames, coordinating internal resources to resolve any issues with the product, and developing strong rapport with clients.

Our clients came from a variety of sectors, including finance, life science, business analytics, infrastructure, raw materials, and more.

Here’s a bit more detail on some of my project management tasks and tools:
- Assisting with drafting statements of work (project scope/deliverables, number of consulting hours, etc.)
- Using project management software such as JIRA (following agile development) and Zendesk
- Managing internal resources pertaining to the project (delegating tasks to colleagues, coordinating support from the engineering team, etc.)

The following are some of the technical tools that I used:
- Python: pandas, numpy, oop, vaex
- Databases: SQL, Redis, Postgres
- Frameworks/Platforms: Flask, AWS, Azure
- Frontend: CSS, HTML, Canva
- Version control: Git, CI/CD pipelines, unit testing
- Other: Bash, Celery (task scheduler), JMeter (load testing)

In addition to app development and project management, I was also responsible for preparing and presenting instructional workshops about the usage of the product. These workshops were attended by users of many different backgrounds and levels of technical expertise, so it was important to cater them in such a way that the most people reaped the most benefit from them. This was a great exercise in disseminating technical information in a palatable and engaging way.

Overall, my time at Plotly provided me with a wide range of experiences, both technical and non-technical. I liked the fact that I worked at the intersection between coding and working with clients - and it certainly increased my interest in the latter.

#### Portfolio and Product Co-op
*Purpose Investments - Toronto, Canada*\
2019

Purpose Investments is an asset management company that manages a number of products, mainly ETFs and mutual funds. As an intern on the product team, I was responsible for many technical and non-technical tasks in supporting the success of the various funds.

One of the main responsibilities of the product team was to create internal reporting tools to provide various financial analytics relating to the performance of the funds, as well as for the market overall. I wrote Python code for development of some of these tools, which included retrieving data (either from data vendors or via web scrapers), transforming and analyzing data, and then creating API endpoints to for the analytics to be fed into the reporting tools. I also used markdown to write corresponding technical documentation for these analytics.

I was also responsible for sending out a daily end-of-day report on the performance of the funds. This report had historically been quite time consuming and tedious to create, so one of my projects was to automate this process for greater accuracy and efficiency. By the end of my internship, I’d written automation that decreased the report creation time from over and hour to less than 10 minutes.

On the non-technical side, some of my other responsibilities included things such as creating and styling slide decks, writing market summaries, drafting and proof-reading reports, and assisting other teams with ad hoc tasks. I even got to act in a promotional commercial for the company.

This internship was great for not only honing my technical skills, but becoming more well rounded in other business skills as well.

#### Junior Python Engineer
*CPP Investments - Toronto, Canada*\
2019

At CPP Investments, I was an intern on the Portfolio Engineering team, which is a subset of the Quantitative Strategies and Risk Premia group - essentially, a group that makes investments based on an algorithmic or quantitive (“quant”) strategy.

One of my main projects was to continue development on an internal tool designed to compare data between production and test environments, including querying data from a SQL database, transforming data, representing results in a tabular or graphical format, and presenting results.

Additionally, I assisted with a project to encourage socialization between members of different teams. Deemed the “Lunch Club”, I wrote code that would match people in random groups and send calendar invites for them to meet for lunch on a bi-weekly basis. This was a fun intersection between technical work and team unity work - and I got to chat with some great people because of it!

As my first internship in software, my time at CPP Investments was a great chance for me to learn industry best practices and understand how programming works in a professional context, while simultaneously learning a lot about the world of finance and particularly quantitative finance.


#### Lab Research Technician
*Centre for Microbial Chemical Biology (McMaster University) - Hamilton, Canada*\
2018

The Centre for Microbial Chemical Biology (CMCB) is a lab within the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University in Hamilton Canada. The lab is home to several PI’s with varying research topics, but many are focused on drug discovery, particularly antibiotic drug discovery, in order to combat the rising issue of antibiotic resistant infections.

I worked as a lab assistant in the core facility of this centre, where most of the equipment is housed. Some of my main tasks included assisting researchers with carrying out their high throughput screening assays, performing QA testing on various pieces of lab equipment to ensure accurate readings, and providing training to grad students on lab safety and proper equipment use.

This role was a great learning experience for me - not only did I greatly improve a lot of my wet lab skills (in the context of some pretty amazing research!), but I improved my ability to work quickly and accurately in a fast paced, constantly changing environment. I’m very thankful for the professional development that this experience afforded me.


#### Teaching Assistant
*University of Waterloo - Waterloo, Canada*\
2017 - 2018

During my undergrad at Waterloo, I spent 3 terms working as a teaching assistant in Biology labs. In this position, I was responsible for running the labs from start to finish with my students. This included presenting pre-lab presentations about the theory behind the day’s experiment, supervising and assisting students as they carried out the experiment, and completing all marking and evaluations for my students.

Additionally, during my last term as a TA, I co-lead a project to pilot new teaching resources for the first year lab course. This involved assessing the effectiveness of the current resources, strategizing how they could be improved, and creating new and improved resources to be rolled out the following term.

My time as a TA taught me how to better understand how students think, and adjust how I present information accordingly to maximize understanding.

### Education
#### Bachelor’s of Science (BSc) - Science and Business (Co-op) - Dean’s Honours
*University of Waterloo*\
2016 - 2021

I began my undergrad in Biochemistry - as someone who had always been fascinated by biology (and the chemistry behind it), this seemed like a good fit. However, after 2 years in this program and one internship in a lab, I began to feel like my program was leading me towards a research-oriented career, and I realized that this was not for me (particularly not in a lab).

Around this time, I was becoming more interested in coding, and had taught myself how to code in Python. The more I learned about programming, the more I learned about how powerful of a tool it is in many sectors, such as in the world of business. With this in mind, I decided to switch to Waterloo’s Science and Business program - a program that builds business skills on top of a science foundation. I felt like this program was the perfect place for me to explore programming in a business context, while still keeping a few science courses in my schedule to satisfy my interest.

After transitioning to the new program, I did my next 2 internships in the fintech sector. These were both great opportunities for me to take my programming skills to the next level and learn more about the world of business. During my school terms, I took a few extra programming courses (alongside the prerequisite science and business courses) to strengthen my understanding of computing fundamentals. From there, I did my last internship at Plotly, where I eventually picked up a full time role after graduating in 2021.
